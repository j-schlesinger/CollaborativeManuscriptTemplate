Document editors, even collaborative ones, lack robustness on tracking changes, and have no oversight on which changes make it into the final draft.
Anyone who has named a document \textit{paper.final.final.docx} knows the pain of determining when changes were added to a particular file.
Version control like git makes it easy to see who made what change when, down to the line number.

In addition, because git can easily hook into other tools when a change is pushed, spelling, grammar, and formatting checks can happen automatically with every change.
